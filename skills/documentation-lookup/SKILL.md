## 📌 Project Status (Feb 7, 2026)

Bl1nk Agents Manager is in active development and is not feature‑complete yet.
This repo contains a working extension shell and a Rust core that is being
brought to feature parity with existing TypeScript logic.

**What works now**
- Extension manifest and Gemini CLI scaffolding are present.
- Core Rust modules exist for agents, hooks, MCP/ACP, sessions, and RPC.
- Command and documentation sets are present (currently being refreshed).

**In progress**
- TypeScript → Rust parity for large subsystems (background agents, config,
  ACP normalization).
- End‑to‑end session flows for Gemini/Codex/Qwen within a unified adapter.
- Validation of hook behavior and task orchestration across agents.

**Known gaps**
- Some Rust modules compile but are not fully wired end‑to‑end.
- Configuration loading/migration is still being aligned to actual runtime.
- Authentication flows for some CLIs still require manual steps.

**What to expect right now**
- You can explore the architecture, commands, and agent catalogs.
- Some workflows will still require manual setup or troubleshooting.

For a complete non‑developer overview, see `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`.

name: documentation-lookup
description: This skill should be used when the user asks about libraries, frameworks, API references, or needs code examples. Activates for setup questions, code generation involving libraries, or mentions of specific frameworks like React, Vue, Next.js, Prisma, Supabase, etc.
---

When the user asks about libraries, frameworks, or needs code examples, use Context7 to fetch current documentation instead of relying on training data.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when the user:

- Asks setup or configuration questions ("How do I configure Next.js middleware?")
- Requests code involving libraries ("Write a Prisma query for...")
- Needs API references ("What are the Supabase auth methods?")
- Mentions specific frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte, Express, Tailwind, etc.)

## How to Fetch Documentation

### Step 1: Resolve the Library ID

Call `resolve-library-id` with:

- `libraryName`: The library name extracted from the user's question
- `query`: The user's full question (improves relevance ranking)

### Step 2: Select the Best Match

From the resolution results, choose based on:

- Exact or closest name match to what the user asked for
- Higher benchmark scores indicate better documentation quality
- If the user mentioned a version (e.g., "React 19"), prefer version-specific IDs

### Step 3: Fetch the Documentation

Call `query-docs` with:

- `libraryId`: The selected Context7 library ID (e.g., `/vercel/next.js`)
- `query`: The user's specific question

### Step 4: Use the Documentation

Incorporate the fetched documentation into your response:

- Answer the user's question using current, accurate information
- Include relevant code examples from the docs
- Cite the library version when relevant

## Guidelines

- **Be specific**: Pass the user's full question as the query for better results
- **Version awareness**: When users mention versions ("Next.js 15", "React 19"), use version-specific library IDs if available from the resolution step
- **Prefer official sources**: When multiple matches exist, prefer official/primary packages over community forks
