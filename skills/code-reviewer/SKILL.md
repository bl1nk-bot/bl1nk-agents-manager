## 📌 Project Status (Feb 7, 2026)

Bl1nk Agents Manager is in active development and is not feature‑complete yet.
This repo contains a working extension shell and a Rust core that is being
brought to feature parity with existing TypeScript logic.

**What works now**
- Extension manifest and Gemini CLI scaffolding are present.
- Core Rust modules exist for agents, hooks, MCP/ACP, sessions, and RPC.
- Command and documentation sets are present (currently being refreshed).

**In progress**
- TypeScript → Rust parity for large subsystems (background agents, config,
  ACP normalization).
- End‑to‑end session flows for Gemini/Codex/Qwen within a unified adapter.
- Validation of hook behavior and task orchestration across agents.

**Known gaps**
- Some Rust modules compile but are not fully wired end‑to‑end.
- Configuration loading/migration is still being aligned to actual runtime.
- Authentication flows for some CLIs still require manual steps.

**What to expect right now**
- You can explore the architecture, commands, and agent catalogs.
- Some workflows will still require manual setup or troubleshooting.

For a complete non‑developer overview, see `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`.

  Use this skill to review code. It supports both local changes (staged or working tree)
  and remote Pull Requests (by ID or URL). It focuses on correctness, maintainability,
  and adherence to project standards for the Bl1nk Agents Manager.

# Code Reviewer

This skill guides the agent in conducting professional and thorough code reviews for both local development and remote Pull Requests in the Bl1nk Agents Manager project.

## Workflow

### 1. Determine Review Target
*   **Remote PR**: If the user provides a PR number or URL (e.g., "Review PR #123"), target that remote PR.
*   **Local Changes**: If no specific PR is mentioned, or if the user asks to "review my changes", target the current local file system states (staged and unstaged changes).

### 2. Preparation

#### For Remote PRs:
1.  **Checkout**: Use the GitHub CLI to checkout the PR.
    ```bash
    gh pr checkout <PR_NUMBER>
    ```
2.  **Preflight**: Execute the project's standard verification suite to catch automated failures early.
    ```bash
    cargo check && cargo test
    ```
3.  **Context**: Read the PR description and any existing comments to understand the goal and history.

#### For Local Changes:
1.  **Identify Changes**:
    *   Check status: `git status`
    *   Read diffs: `git diff` (working tree) and/or `git diff --staged` (staged).
2.  **Preflight (Optional)**: If the changes are substantial, ask the user if they want to run `cargo check && cargo test` before reviewing.

### 3. In-Depth Analysis
Analyze the code changes based on the following pillars:

*   **Correctness**: Does the code achieve its stated purpose without bugs or logical errors?
*   **Maintainability**: Is the code clean, well-structured, and easy to understand and modify in the future? Consider factors like code clarity, modularity, and adherence to established design patterns.
*   **Readability**: Is the code well-commented (where necessary) and consistently formatted according to our project's coding style guidelines? Follow Rustfmt conventions.
*   **Efficiency**: Are there any obvious performance bottlenecks or resource inefficiencies introduced by the changes?
*   **Security**: Are there any potential security vulnerabilities or insecure coding practices?
*   **Edge Cases and Error Handling**: Does the code appropriately handle edge cases and potential errors? Follow Rust's Result and Option patterns.
*   **Testability**: Is the new or modified code adequately covered by tests (unit and integration)? Suggest additional test cases that would improve coverage or robustness.

### 4. Provide Feedback

#### Structure
*   **Summary**: A high-level overview of the review.
*   **Findings**:
    *   **Critical**: Bugs, security issues, or breaking changes.
    *   **Improvements**: Suggestions for better code quality or performance.
    *   **Nitpicks**: Formatting or minor style issues (optional).
*   **Conclusion**: Clear recommendation (Approved / Request Changes).

#### Tone
*   Be constructive, professional, and friendly.
*   Explain *why* a change is requested.
*   For approvals, acknowledge the specific value of the contribution.

### 5. Cleanup (Remote PRs only)
*   After the review, ask the user if they want to switch back to the default branch (e.g., `main` or `master`).
