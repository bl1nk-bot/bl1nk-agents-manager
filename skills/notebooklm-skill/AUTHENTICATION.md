# Authentication Architecture
## 📌 Project Status (Feb 7, 2026)

Bl1nk Agents Manager is in active development and is not feature‑complete yet.
This repo contains a working extension shell and a Rust core that is being
brought to feature parity with existing TypeScript logic.

**What works now**
- Extension manifest and Gemini CLI scaffolding are present.
- Core Rust modules exist for agents, hooks, MCP/ACP, sessions, and RPC.
- Command and documentation sets are present (currently being refreshed).

**In progress**
- TypeScript → Rust parity for large subsystems (background agents, config,
  ACP normalization).
- End‑to‑end session flows for Gemini/Codex/Qwen within a unified adapter.
- Validation of hook behavior and task orchestration across agents.

**Known gaps**
- Some Rust modules compile but are not fully wired end‑to‑end.
- Configuration loading/migration is still being aligned to actual runtime.
- Authentication flows for some CLIs still require manual steps.

**What to expect right now**
- You can explore the architecture, commands, and agent catalogs.
- Some workflows will still require manual setup or troubleshooting.

For a complete non‑developer overview, see `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`.

## Overview

This skill uses a **hybrid authentication approach** that combines the best of both worlds:

1. **Persistent Browser Profile** (`user_data_dir`) for consistent browser fingerprinting
2. **Manual Cookie Injection** from `state.json` for reliable session cookie persistence

## Why This Approach?

### The Problem

Playwright/Patchright has a known bug ([#36139](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/36139)) where **session cookies** (cookies without an `Expires` attribute) do not persist correctly when using `launch_persistent_context()` with `user_data_dir`.

**What happens:**
- ✅ Persistent cookies (with `Expires` date) → Saved correctly to browser profile
- ❌ Session cookies (without `Expires`) → **Lost after browser restarts**

**Impact:**
- Some Google auth cookies are session cookies
- Users experience random authentication failures
- "Works on my machine" syndrome (depends on which cookies Google uses)

### TypeScript vs Python

The **MCP Server** (TypeScript) can work around this by passing `storage_state` as a parameter:

```typescript
// TypeScript - works!
const context = await chromium.launchPersistentContext(userDataDir, {
  storageState: "state.json",  // ← Loads cookies including session cookies
  channel: "chrome"
});
```

But **Python's Playwright API doesn't support this** ([#14949](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/14949)):

```python
# Python - NOT SUPPORTED!
context = playwright.chromium.launch_persistent_context(
    user_data_dir=profile_dir,
    storage_state="state.json",  # ← Parameter not available in Python!
    channel="chrome"
)
```

## Our Solution: Hybrid Approach

We use a **two-phase authentication system**:

### Phase 1: Setup (`auth_manager.py setup`)

1. Launch persistent context with `user_data_dir`
2. User logs in manually
3. **Save state to TWO places:**
   - Browser profile directory (automatic, for fingerprint + persistent cookies)
   - `state.json` file (explicit save, for session cookies)

```python
context = playwright.chromium.launch_persistent_context(
    user_data_dir="browser_profile/",
    channel="chrome"
)
# User logs in...
context.storage_state(path="state.json")  # Save all cookies
```

### Phase 2: Runtime (`ask_question.py`)

1. Launch persistent context with `user_data_dir` (loads fingerprint + persistent cookies)
2. **Manually inject cookies** from `state.json` (adds session cookies)

```python
# Step 1: Launch with browser profile
context = playwright.chromium.launch_persistent_context(
    user_data_dir="browser_profile/",
    channel="chrome"
)

# Step 2: Manually inject cookies from state.json
with open("state.json", 'r') as f:
    state = json.load(f)
    context.add_cookies(state['cookies'])  # ← Workaround for session cookies!
```

## Benefits

| Feature | Our Approach | Pure `user_data_dir` | Pure `storage_state` |
|---------|--------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Browser Fingerprint Consistency** | ✅ Same across restarts | ✅ Same | ❌ Changes each time |
| **Session Cookie Persistence** | ✅ Manual injection | ❌ Lost (bug) | ✅ Native support |
| **Persistent Cookie Persistence** | ✅ Automatic | ✅ Automatic | ✅ Native support |
| **Google Trust** | ✅ High (same browser) | ✅ High | ❌ Low (new browser) |
| **Cross-platform Reliability** | ✅ Chrome required | ⚠️ Chromium issues | ✅ Portable |
| **Cache Performance** | ✅ Keeps cache | ✅ Keeps cache | ❌ No cache |

## Why `state.json` is Critical

Even though we use `user_data_dir`, we **still need `state.json`** because:

1. **Session cookies** are not saved to the browser profile (Playwright bug)
2. **Manual injection** is the only reliable way to load session cookies
3. **Validation** - we can check if cookies are expired before launching

## Code References

**Setup:** `scripts/auth_manager.py:94-120`
- Lines 100-113: Launch persistent context with `channel="chrome"`
- Line 167: Save to `state.json` via `context.storage_state()`

**Runtime:** `scripts/ask_question.py:77-118`
- Lines 86-99: Launch persistent context
- Lines 101-118: Manual cookie injection workaround

**Validation:** `scripts/auth_manager.py:236-298`
- Lines 262-275: Launch persistent context
- Lines 277-287: Manual cookie injection for validation

## Future Improvements

If Playwright adds support for `storage_state` parameter in Python's `launch_persistent_context()`, we can simplify to:

```python
# Future (when Python API supports it):
context = playwright.chromium.launch_persistent_context(
    user_data_dir="browser_profile/",
    storage_state="state.json",  # ← Would handle everything automatically!
    channel="chrome"
)
```

Until then, our hybrid approach is the most reliable solution.
