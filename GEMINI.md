# 🤖 Bl1nk Agents Manager Extension
## 📌 Project Status (Feb 7, 2026)

Bl1nk Agents Manager is in active development and is not feature‑complete yet.
This repo contains a working extension shell and a Rust core that is being
brought to feature parity with existing TypeScript logic.

**What works now**
- Extension manifest and Gemini CLI scaffolding are present.
- Core Rust modules exist for agents, hooks, MCP/ACP, sessions, and RPC.
- Command and documentation sets are present (currently being refreshed).

**In progress**
- TypeScript → Rust parity for large subsystems (background agents, config,
  ACP normalization).
- End‑to‑end session flows for Gemini/Codex/Qwen within a unified adapter.
- Validation of hook behavior and task orchestration across agents.

**Known gaps**
- Some Rust modules compile but are not fully wired end‑to‑end.
- Configuration loading/migration is still being aligned to actual runtime.
- Authentication flows for some CLIs still require manual steps.

**What to expect right now**
- You can explore the architecture, commands, and agent catalogs.
- Some workflows will still require manual setup or troubleshooting.

For a complete non‑developer overview, see `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`.
## 🌟 What are System Agents?

System Agents are specialized agent definitions that define how the Gemini CLI behaves. Instead of a generic assistant, you can load a specific persona with expert knowledge, unique speech patterns, or strict behavioral constraints.

This extension provides:

1. **A Curated Library**: 48+ high-quality, pre-tested agents for engineering, writing, research, and entertainment.
2. **Management Commands**: CLI tools to list, inspect, switch, and create agents.
3. **Extensibility**: A structure to add your own custom agents.
4. **Hooks System**: 35+ hooks for automation and context injection.

## 📌 Gemini CLI Cheatsheet

For day-to-day CLI usage and options, see the local cheatsheet:

- `docs/GEMINI_CLI_CHEATSHEET.md`

## 💡 How to Switch Agents

**Important:** You cannot switch agents in the *middle* of a running session because the system prompt is loaded at startup. To switch agents, you must set the `GEMINI_SYSTEM_MD` environment variable and start a new session.

The `/system-agent:switch` command will generate the exact commands you need.

**Common Methods:**

1. **Temporary (One-off session):**

   ```bash
   GEMINI_SYSTEM_MD=~/.gemini/extensions/agents-manager/agents/pirate.md gemini
   ```

2. **Persistent (Until shell exit):**

   ```bash
   export GEMINI_SYSTEM_MD=~/.gemini/extensions/agents-manager/agents/architect.md
   gemini
   ```

3. **Aliases (Recommended):**
   Add these to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

   ```bash
   alias gemini-pirate="GEMINI_SYSTEM_MD=~/.gemini/extensions/agents-manager/agents/pirate.md gemini"
   alias gemini-code="GEMINI_SYSTEM_MD=~/.gemini/extensions/agents-manager/agents/code-generator.md gemini"
   ```

```

### Adding a New Agent

1. Create a new `.md` file in `agents/`
2. Add the agent's metadata to `agents/agents.json`
3. (Optional) If it's a "custom" user agent, the logic in `system-agent.toml` looks for a `custom/agents.json` file relative to the extension path

### Creating Custom Hooks

1. Create a new module in `crates/core/src/hooks/`
2. Implement the hook interface
3. Register in `crates/core/src/hooks/mod.rs`
